# General dev goals

- Develop modular code for specific tasks
- Integrate into R functions. Decide whether common functions can be used across equipment types. If so, need function prompts or data type parameters for some processes
- Integrate into a lab field-processing library

## More Specific task types

- Streamline data import and cleaning (i.e. preliminary handling of errors, formatting, data quality flagging(?))
- Enable "cleaned" data merging and production of set time interval clean products (e.g. yearly)
- Create automated data processing 
- Manage and create metadata
