1) Field data collection: 
	- Standardized download directory organization.
	Suggestion-- Site: Equipment type
	- metadata on every download. Include downloader, equipment status notes, action alerts. 	So…we need equipment metadata forms ahead of time. We can either have full metadata files by 	piece of equipment that stay on the tablets or have some code for I ntegrating current session notes 	with previous notes.

2) Data upload to shared drive (?).
	- Options: Automated or manual. It’s pretty easy to just copy and paste, although automated could ensure consistent labelling and later easier programmatic extraction of data.

3) Data cleaning:
	- Format for inter-data type consistency (e.g. time format)
	- Make sure there is a common missing data flag between data types.
	- Preliminary flagging of erroneous data
	- Output into intermediate/cleaned data folders

4) Data processing: Anything else that we typically do to make the data useable that goes beyond basic cleaning. E.g. calculations, addressing errors

5) Data products: 
	- Consistent time-period products (e.g. yearly products)
	- On-demand time-period products
	- Preliminary results: Exploratory visualizations + summary statistics
